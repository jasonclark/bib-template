This project is related to research about creating a book in the browser first presented at Access 2013 in St. John's, NL. 

These files are for use with the [Treesaver Walkthrough](https://github.com/Treesaver/treesaver/wiki/Walkthrough). The files in this repo provide a skeleton "proof of concept" app for learning purposes. Youn can find the data model (MySQL sample DB) for the app in the /meta/assets/ directory.

Contact me if you have questions or are interested in developing the project.
